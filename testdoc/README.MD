# Test Documentation for EventConnect-App

This directory contains the test suites and test cases for the EventConnect-App, organized by sprint iterations. Each markdown file within this directory corresponds to a specific sprint and includes test cases designed based on the user stories planned for that sprint.

## Overview

The test files are named according to the sprint they belong to, making it easy to track and manage the testing process alongside the development cycle. For instance, `Testsuite_Sprint2.md` contains test cases for features developed during Sprint 2 of the project.

## Test Files

- `Testsuite_Sprint2.md`: Test cases for user stories completed in Sprint 2. This includes tests for profile creation, event creation, and more.
- `Testsuite_Sprint3.md`: Test cases for user stories targeted in Sprint 3, focusing on enhancements such as map integration for event viewing.
- `Testsuite_Sprint4.md`: Test cases that cover the functionalities planned for Sprint 4, including group management and event privacy settings.

## File Structure

Each test suite file includes:

- **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for each test case.
- **Title**: A short title describing the test case scenario.
- **Description**: Details about what the test case will verify.
- **Preconditions**: Preconditions that must be met before the test is executed.
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step instructions on how to carry out the test.
- **Expected Results**: The expected outcome if the feature behaves as intended.
- **Actual Results**: A section left blank for testers to fill in after executing the test.

## Usage

Testers should follow the test steps outlined in each test case to validate the functionality described by the user stories. After performing the tests, the 'Actual Results' section should be completed with the findings. This helps in maintaining a clear record of test outcomes and any issues that may need attention.

For any changes or updates to test cases, please ensure to maintain the format and update the documentation accordingly.
